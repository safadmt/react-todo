# React CRUD App with State Management and Local Storage

## Overview

This is a React application that implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface with state management using reducers and context. The app uses local storage for persistent data storage across sessions.

## Features

- **State Management:** Utilizes `useReducer` and `useContext` for state management.
- **CRUD Operations:** Supports create, read, update, and delete operations for items.
- **Local Storage:** Data is persisted using `localStorage` to maintain state across page reloads.
